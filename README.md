old_code-updates_in_process
===========================

Lots of incomplete, learning-exercise-ish, and/or plain bad code, written in a variety of languages ( including ones I didn't or don't know ).

Uploaded to a public repo, so that embarrassment will steadily force me to:
    (1) finish it
    (2) fix it
    (3) rewrite it, now that I know what I'm doing
    (4) any combination of items 1-3...
    (5) eliminate it for your sake and mine
	
Forking this repo should be regarded as dangerous and reason for intervention by other concerned coders. Don't do it!

Revised code will be removed from this repo and, barring condition (5), promoted to a repo carrying a less emphatic disclaimer.
